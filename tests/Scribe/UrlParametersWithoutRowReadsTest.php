 * written into it as an example is a disclosure, not a cosmetic issue. Scribe's stock
 * `GetFromLaravelAPI` ends its Eloquent inference with `$modelInstance::first()->{$routeKey}`; the
 * replacement keeps the type inference and drops that read.
 *
 * Every test here asserts against BOTH strategies — the stock one as a live control. Without it the
 * suite cannot tell "the read is suppressed" from "the read never happened in this fixture", and
 * that distinction is the whole ticket: the app's own reason for never having leaked turned out to
 * be the fixture (tenant-schema tables absent from the central schema), not a guard.
