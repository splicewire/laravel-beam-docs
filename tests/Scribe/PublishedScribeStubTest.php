/**
 * The `beam-scribe` stub is a **published artifact with no reader inside this package** — nothing here
 * requires it, so 861 green tests said nothing about whether it works. Ticket 07 found out the way that
 * class of gap is always found: `splicewire/www` published it, ran `scribe:generate`, and got
 * `Target class [Splicewire\Beam\Scribe\OpenApi\TagGroupGenerator] does not exist` — the class is
 * `TagHierarchyGenerator`, and had been all along.
 *
 * A wrong class name in a config stub is invisible from every angle inside the authoring package: it is a
 * string in a file that is copied, not loaded. It detonates in the host, after publication, at the moment
 * the host runs the generator the stub exists to configure — which on a fresh starter is the first boot
 * the OTB promise is being judged on.
 *
 * So this test **is** the reader. It evaluates the stub the same way Laravel's config loader would and
 * resolves every class it names, which turns "the stub is publishable" from an assumption into an
 * assertion. It is the same shape as beam-ux's codec round-trip guard and `DeadConfigKeyAudit`: the
 * durable fix for a write path nothing reads is to give it one.
