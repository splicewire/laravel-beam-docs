 * The artifact routes are PUBLIC by default (ADR-0211 §5) — a docs surface nobody can read is not a docs
 * surface, and the real contract boundary is the published scribe stub's `api/*` match rules, not the
 * route. A host that wants the spec behind auth says so in config, exactly as it does for the intake door.
 *
 * Middleware is read when the routes are MOUNTED, so it has to be set pre-boot — hence its own class.
