 * A generator that accepts NOTHING — the case that turns a hardcoded generator into a crash.

 * bare `new JsonSchemaGenerator` would have tried anyway. A consumer that resolves the chain
 * without asking `canGenerate()` first therefore converts an advisory audit into a boot-time
 * fatal at exactly the hosts whose `generators` list differs from the flagship's.
