/**
 * An `operationId` is a function of the ROUTE, never of the sidebar title (api-surface-coherence 36/78).
 *
 * Two rungs, in order, and the title is not consulted at either:
 *
 *  1. **(E) the declaration** — `action['beam']['operationId']`, written by the mount that registered the
 *     route and read back through {@see RouteMetadataReader::operationId()}. ONE key, N declarers: a generator
 *     with an arm per stamp family (`_particle`, `_renderings`, `_renderings_catalog`, `_versions`, …)
 *     needs a new arm every time a macro is added, so the reading was inverted instead.
 *  2. **(B) the wire shape** — verb + the FULL uri, params included as segments, nothing stripped.
 *     `GET api/v1/embeds/{id}/versions` → `getApiV1EmbedsIdVersions`.
 *
 * ## Why a title is not an identifier
 *
 * Scribe derives `operationId` from `metadata->title` and nothing else
 * (`OpenApiSpecGenerators\BaseGenerator::operationId()`), which fails at being an identifier three ways at
 * once. It is **non-unique**: a macro mount puts ONE controller method on N routes, they all inherit its
 * docblock summary, and N operations ship one id — invalid OpenAPI, and a client generator either collides
 * or silently drops all but one. It is **not always an identifier at all**: Scribe's
 * `preg_replace('/[^\w+]/', '', …)` character class KEEPS `+` (almost certainly a typo for `[^\w]`), and
 * four shipped ids carried a literal `+`. And it is **unstable**: rewording a summary silently renames a
 * generated SDK class.
 *
 * This runs after `BaseGenerator` and **overwrites** what it wrote — it does not defer. The precedence is
 * total, so no operation ever reaches the vendor branch and the `+` bug is superseded rather than patched.
 *
 * ## The fallback is deliberately unlovely — do not "improve" it
 *
 * Both obvious improvements are unsafe, and 36 Q8 wrote that down so nobody re-derives it the hard way.
 * **Dropping path params** reintroduces collisions (`/embeds/{id}/versions` would merge with
 * `/embeds/versions`), which is the one property (B) exists to hold. **Stripping the `api/v1` prefix**
 * stops being safe the moment a second prefix (`/api/operator`) is documented. Beyond safety it is a
 * standing incentive: an ugly SDK class name is the cost of not declaring, and the failure mode of a
 * family that has not declared is *ugly but unique*, never duplicate. A missing declaration degrades; it
 * does not break.
 *
 * ## The route is still reachable at assembly time
 *
 * Ticket 32 recorded that a document-assembly generator cannot help, "because Scribe hands it an
 * `OutputEndpointData` which has already dropped the Laravel route". Scribe drops the route REFERENCE, not
 * the route: it is still in the router, and `verb + uri` is an exact key back into it (measured over the
 * whole shipped document — 0 mismatches). What survives of 32's claim is narrower and was verified:
 * `Knuckles\Camel\Extraction\Metadata` has no custom bag, so an extraction strategy could only ever have
 * carried a TITLE forward — which is the coupling being removed.
