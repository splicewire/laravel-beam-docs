/**
 * Stash what a particle OPERATION actually puts on the wire, for {@see DeliveryGenerator} to
 * write at document assembly (particle-operation-surface 14).
 *
 * Written as the sibling of the rendering surface's `ResourceRenderingResponseStrategy`, deliberately
 * the same shape down to the stash key, because the two surfaces produced the identical contract —
 * media types, added headers, the applied default format, the format enumeration — and shared one
 * document-assembly hook rather than growing a second copy of it that drifts. particle-operation-surface
 * 13 then deleted that sibling; this is the surviving writer, and the shared hook is why its deletion
 * changed no published media type.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all, rather than falling out of `output:`
 *
 * `output:` names a Data class. It answers *what JSON shape comes back*, and is structurally silent
 * about the case that needs answering: an operation that returns a PDF, a calendar, a zip, or a stream
 * of bytes. `media.download` is the estate's proof — a `kind: Read` operation whose handler returns a
 * Symfony `StreamedResponse` straight through, published as an untyped 200 with no media type at all
 * until this landed. And Scribe's own model is one-content-type-per-status
 * (`BaseGenerator::generateEndpointResponsesSpec()` silently discards a second response whose content
 * type differs), so even a hand-written `@response` could not say "200, in these six media types".
 *
 * ## Silence is the whole default
 *
 * Defers (`null`) for any non-operation route, AND returns `[]` — handled, nothing stashed — for an
 * operation that declares no `delivery:`. Every declaration in the estate is in that second state, so
 * this strategy is a no-op on all of them: the generator sees no stash and leaves the endpoint exactly
 * as the response strategies built it. The widening is one-directional by construction.
 *
 * Returns `[]` rather than a fabricated example body for the same reason its rendering sibling does:
 * there is no single example for an endpoint that answers in several media types, and Scribe's example
 * renderer would have to pick one.
