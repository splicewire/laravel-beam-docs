/**
 * Document a DISSOLVED particle index's full list contract from the declarations the route already carries.
 *
 * The sibling of {@see ParticleRequestStrategy} one axis over: the schema signal is the ROUTE (its
 * `_particle` default names a {@see ParticleResource}), and {@see ParticleResource::$key} IS the
 * data-filters resource key, so this needs ZERO new declaration — no config lookup, no per-resource
 * registration.
 *
 * Two sources, deliberately, because neither is sufficient alone (api-surface-coherence ticket 07 §2):
 *
 *  - **The SET** comes from {@see ResourceQuery::filterNames()} and friends,
 *    which merge the attribute-declared facets with the imperative `extraFilters()`/`extraSorts()`/
 *    `extraIncludes()` escape hatches. Deriving the set from the schema instead would silently DROP every
 *    closure filter — relocating the exact defect this strategy exists to close.
 *  - **The TYPES** come from the generated Filter-Data schema (the same generator and
 *    `config('data-schemas.strategies')` wiring `filter-schema/{resource}` serves at runtime), joined to
 *    the set by facet NAME — not property name, since `#[Filterable(name: …)]` routinely renames a facet.
 *    A name with no backing property documents as UNTYPED; it is never omitted.
 *
 * Four axes, one strategy: `filter[…]`, `sort`, `include`, and pagination. They all ride the same
 * spatie/laravel-query-builder grammar off the same resource key, so splitting them would be four
 * resolutions of one declaration for no gained knob.
 *
 * Every name here is DERIVED, never spelled: the `filter`/`sort`/`include` prefixes come from
 * `config('query-builder.parameters')` and pagination from {@see ParticleController::PAGE}/`PER_PAGE`,
 * so the camelCase cutover (ticket 22) carries the reference with it and nothing in this file changes.
 *
 * Returns `null` (defer) for any non-particle route, so it composes transparently alongside Scribe's
 * stock query-parameter strategies.

     * It used to be `$endpointData->method?->getName() === 'index'`, and that proxy was wrong in BOTH
     * directions (api-surface-coherence 103), measured at the flagship against the booted router:
     *
     *  - **Under-triggered by 1.** `GET /api/v1/guest-tokens` is served by `GuestTokenController@indexAll`
     *    — a second collection action on one controller — so the resource's declared filter/sort contract
     *    was absent from the spec while its circuit-scoped twin published three parameters. Same resource,
     *    same data-filters key, different documentation.
     *  - **Over-triggered by 96.** Every SUB-SURFACE mounted beside a resource carries the same
     *    `_particle` stamp and is served by a controller whose method is *also* called `index`:
     *    `ResourceDiscoveryController` (38 routes), `HookEventCatalogController` (32) and
     *    `ResourceFiltersController` (26). The saved-filter LISTING at `GET /{resource}/filters` was
     *    therefore documented as accepting `filter[…]`, `sort`, `include`, `page` and `perPage` off the
     *    resource it lists saved filters FOR — none of which it reads. That half was invisible, because a
     *    contract published where none is served produces no error anywhere.
     *
     * So the gate is two questions, not one. **Which surface** is a stamped fact ({@see SubSurface::of()},
     * ticket 105) read off the route's own defaults — the sub-surfaces classify themselves at mount time,
     * so this is a lookup rather than a parse. **Which action** is asked declaration-first:
     *
     *  1. `->beam()->returns(X::class, many: true)` — an explicitly declared cardinality
     *     ({@see RouteMetadataReader::returnsMany()}). 3 routes at the flagship.
     *  2. {@see BeamRouteProxy::FILTERS_PROMISE} — `->beam()->inResource($key, filters: true)`, whose own
     *     docblock defines the flag as *"this route is the resource's INDEX at this exposure"*. 12 routes,
     *     and the one that lets `indexAll` in.
     *  3. …and, where neither is declared, the method name — kept, named, and CONFINED to the CRUD
     *     surface, where a method called `index` genuinely means the resource's index.
     *
     * ⚠️ **Rung 3 is a convention, not a declaration, and three flagship routes rest on it alone:**
     * `GET api/v1/silos`, `GET api/v1/agents`, `GET api/v1/circuits` — hand-mounted indexes that declare
     * neither cardinality nor a filter promise. Dropping the rung would silently strip a filter contract
     * those three genuinely serve, so the honest move is to report the declaration gap rather than take
     * the documentation away: each of them wants one word (`filters: true`, or a `many: true` return) at
     * its mount, after which this rung can go. It is scoped rather than removed for the same reason
     * {@see RouteReturnType} keeps its own name-shaped fallback — a missing declaration must degrade,
     * not break.
