/**
 * Serves the OpenAPI artifact at the two fixed, package-owned URLs beam mounts (ADR-0211 §1/§2):
 * `GET beam/openapi.yaml` and `GET beam/openapi.json`, one controller, one
 * {@see OpenApiSpecSource}.
 *
 * The artifact is deliberately NOT a `BeamUxEntry`. It is a generated build artifact, served by
 * the optional documentation package through the same access policy as authored documentation. The docs *page* is the entry (ADR-0210 §9); it embeds
 * `<ApiReference specUrl={route('beam.openapi.yaml')} />` and points here.
 *
 * ADR-0116's concern is a package claiming UNMATCHED urls — which is why the entry renderer is
 * host-mounted (ADR-0209) — and two fixed paths are not that.
 *
 * Nothing here generates. Generation happens at install and at deploy (ADR-0211 §4): extraction reflects
 * over every route in the application, and a public `GET` must not write to storage. With no artifact,
 * both URLs 404 cleanly — which is the honest answer for a host that has not run the generator yet.
