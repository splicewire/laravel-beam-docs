/**
 * The default {@see OpenApiSpecSource}: one artifact on disk at `beam.docs.openapi.artifact`, served
 * as-is for YAML and derived for JSON (ADR-0211 §2/§6).
 *
 * ## Why a configured DISK PATH and not Scribe's own resolution
 *
 * Reading the location back off Scribe's internal `$this->paths` resolution would couple beam to
 * something it does not control. Hard-coding it would foreclose the pre-generated-variant future the
 * §3 seam exists to keep open. A disk path is also not a URL, so it does not reopen the docs-path
 * question ticket 02 settled — the public path is fixed and package-owned.
 *
 * ## Why the JSON derivation is cached on MTIME
 *
 * Parsing a half-megabyte YAML document and re-encoding it on every request is real work, and both
 * representations must be incapable of drifting apart. Keying the cache entry on the artifact's mtime
 * gives both properties for free: a regeneration changes the mtime, which changes the key, so the next
 * request derives afresh and no invalidation call is needed anywhere. The cost is one live key per
 * regeneration — the superseded entries are dead weight the store evicts, never stale answers.
 *
 * A public `GET` still writes NOTHING to storage (ADR-0211 §4). The cache is a cache.

     *
     * The ADR named a literal `storage_path('app/scribe/openapi.yaml')`. On a real bare host that is
     * WRONG and 404s out of the box: Scribe writes through `Storage::disk('local')`
     * ({@see Writer::writeOpenAPISpec()}), and the Laravel 11+ skeleton roots the
     * local disk at `storage/app/private`, not `storage/app`. A fresh `laravel-beam-starter` generated its
     * spec to `storage/app/private/scribe/openapi.yaml` while beam looked for it one directory up.
     *
     * Deriving from `filesystems.disks.local.root` is not the coupling §6 warned against — that was about
     * reading Scribe's INTERNAL `$this->paths` resolution. The local disk root is ordinary published
     * Laravel config, it is the same value Scribe itself resolves through, and it follows a host that
     * repoints the disk. The `scribe/` subdirectory is Scribe's default output dir (`--scribe-dir`
