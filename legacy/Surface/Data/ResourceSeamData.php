/**
 * One **resource seam** — a single addressable operation on an API surface (`GET /api/v1/specs/{id}`),
 * as the *document* describes it.
 *
 * Deliberately stack-blind: nothing here knows about Laravel routing, Splicewire, or compliance. It is
 * the parsed shadow of one OpenAPI operation object and nothing more, so the same class carries a
 * foreign vendor's spec as faithfully as our own.
 *
 * **`security` is nullable on purpose, and null is not the empty list.** `null` means the document never
 * said — neither the operation nor the document root declared a security requirement — which is a
 * *gap*. `[]` means the document explicitly declared `security: []`, i.e. "this operation is public",
 * which is a *claim* we can agree or disagree with. Collapsing the two would turn "you didn't tell us"
 * into "you told us it's open", which is the exact conflation the corroborator exists to avoid.
