/**
 * The result of comparing one document against one runtime: per-seam **agreement**, **disagreement**,
 * and **gap**.
 *
 * The three are kept in separate lists rather than as a `status` on one list because they are read at
 * different urgencies and by different people. Agreement is the boring majority and exists only so the
 * denominator is honest; the disagreements are the work-list; the gaps are the "we could not tell"
 * column that must never quietly merge into either neighbour.
 *
 * `mode` is on the envelope, not buried in a note, so a spec-only run cannot be mistaken for a
 * corroborated one by a reader who skims. Every finding also carries its own
 * {@see SurfaceFindingData::$provenanceRank}, so the distinction survives being flattened into a report.
